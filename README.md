## Problem Statement

###### (A) In order to maintain a good CRM (Customer Relationship Management), a company should be aware of each customerâ€™s attitude towards the company. The company should know the answers to the following questions:
        1.	when did the customer last purchased? (Recency)
        2.	how often does the customer purchase? (Frequency)
        3.	how much money did the customer spend? (Monetary)
##### (B)  Market Basket Analysis (Support, Lift, Confidence) with the help of association rules helps to find out which item will also be picked along the the previously purchsed item ( A consequent is an item found in combination with the antecedent)
